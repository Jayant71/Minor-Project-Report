\section{Challenges Faced}
During the implementation of this project, several significant challenges emerged that required careful consideration and strategic solutions. One of the most pressing issues was related to computational constraints. Running large-scale experiments, particularly those involving complex machine learning models, proved to be extremely resource-intensive. The team frequently encountered situations where experimental parameters needed to be adjusted to fit within available budget and time constraints, which sometimes compromised the optimal execution of certain experiments. This challenge necessitated the development of sophisticated resource allocation strategies and the implementation of efficient scheduling algorithms to maximize the utilization of available computational resources while maintaining the integrity of research objectives. \\Error handling in automated systems presented another substantial challenge throughout the project lifecycle. The automation pipeline occasionally exhibited unstable behavior, with code execution errors and experimental runs showing unexpected results. These issues were particularly difficult to diagnose and resolve, often requiring extensive debugging sessions that consumed significant development time. The complexity of the automated systems meant that errors could propagate through multiple stages of the research process, making isolation and resolution of issues particularly challenging. This experience led to the implementation of more robust error handling mechanisms and the development of comprehensive testing protocols to ensure system stability and reliability.\\The limitations of novelty detection emerged as a third major challenge in our implementation. Despite implementing sophisticated algorithms for checking the uniqueness of research ideas, the system occasionally failed to identify redundant or previously explored concepts. This shortcoming highlighted the complexity of automated research validation and the challenges inherent in programmatically assessing the originality of scientific ideas. To address this issue, we continuously refined our novelty detection algorithms, incorporating additional parameters and metrics to improve accuracy. The experience emphasized the importance of maintaining a balance between automated assessment and human oversight in the research validation process, leading to the development of a hybrid approach that combined computational analysis with expert review for optimal results.
