\normalsize Developing agents capable of autonomously conducting scientific research and discovering new knowledge is a major challenge in artificial general intelligence. While large language models (LLMs) have assisted human scientists in tasks like brainstorming and coding, they handle only a fraction of the scientific process. This paper introduces The AutoIdeaFlow, the first comprehensive framework enabling LLMs to perform end-to-end scientific discovery, including idea generation, coding, experimentation, result visualization, paper writing, and simulated review. Applied to three machine learning subfields—diffusion modeling, transformer-based language modeling, and learning dynamics—The AutoIdeaFlow can develop full papers at under \$15 each, democratizing research and accelerating scientific progress. An automated reviewer evaluates these papers with near-human accuracy, demonstrating that The AutoIdeaFlow can produce work meeting top conference standards. This framework heralds a new era of AI-driven scientific discovery, fostering continuous innovation on complex global challenges.
