\normalsize Lack of attention while reading is a critical challenge in education, often leading to reduced comprehension and learning outcomes. To address this, we propose a novel real-time system that monitors reader attention by combining object detection and gaze estimation. Our method uses YOLO for accurate book detection and integrates AWS Rekognition to assess gaze direction, determining whether the reader is focused on the book. This lightweight, cloud-assisted approach enables efficient, scalable deployment. The system has strong potential in personalized education, enabling adaptive learning platforms that respond to student engagement levels.
